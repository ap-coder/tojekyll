<h1 style="text-align: center;">OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE CODE READERS THRIVE</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Code has barcode solutions for any industry. Where fast, accurate, and reliable scanning of even damaged barcodes makes the difference in quality patient care—for those that need a technology upgrade and the ability to scan barcodes others can't.....</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>There is only Code.</strong></h4>

<h6>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC SAFETY</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14716 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-safety-cr1000-barcode-scanners.jpg" alt="public-safety-cr1000-barcode-scanners" width="475" height="317" />Code offers a full line of barcode scanners that are built to stand up to the fast-paced public safety &amp; government environments. Available in tethered, presentation, and mobile form factors - there is a reader for every necessary functionality. Whether it is evidence tracking, DMV, ID parsing, there is a Code solution.

Barcode scanning can take a task of minutes down to seconds, and it has become a valuable asset to public safety processes and is now a fixture in cruisers, offices, courts, and elsewhere. Officers who have a barcode scanner in their cruiser can dramatically decrease their time-per-traffic-stop, which in turn can help keep them safe.

Consider these products for your government workflow:

 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/">Code Reader™ 1500</a></li>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-5000/">Code Reader™ 5000</a></li>
</ul>



<h6>EVENT MANAGEMENT, FOOD &amp; DRINK, HOTELS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14717 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trade_show_people.jpg" alt="trade_show_people" width="470" height="314" />There are many aspects of hospitality where barcode scanning will increase efficiency and save time and money. Code readers thrive in all different environments and industries, and it hospitality is no different.

Bars, restaurants, and convenience stores can implement a zero-miss Code scanner to verify age of patrons, scan loyalty cards, parse ID information, and check guests out. Code's CR5000 can quickly and accurately scan any ID card and verify age straight through the reader.

For event management, a Code scanner can quickly and reliably scan the barcode of each attendees ticket. It will easily identify fraudulent tickets, and when tickets are on a mobile device screen a Code solution will read it no problem.

Consider these products for your hospitality workflow:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-950/">Code Reader™ 950</a></li>

</ul>



<h6>E-FORMS</h6>
Populate loyalty program forms, in-store credit applications and more, with Code’s driver license parsing applications.

Code barcode readers are built on a JavaScript platform, which has allowed our Application Engineers to develop patented applications that control the logic of how barcoded data is processed, encrypted, displayed and then inputted into enterprise solutions.

The programming versatility of Code barcode readers, allows them to parse data from all barcoded government-issued identification to quickly populate forms to eliminate data entry errors and enhance the customers’ experience.

<h6>SEED-TO-SALE SOLUTIONS</h6>
<img class="wp-image-13658 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MARIJUANA-SEED2SALE-03.jpg" alt="Seed-2-Sale" width="528" height="215" />Code was one of the first industries to step into the cannabis industry. As the industry continues to grow so do state and federal regulations. From seed to sale, the barcode will be your ticket of compliance and Code has your back. At Code, we specialize in <strong>real</strong> workflow data capture solutions. What does this mean? It means our barcode scanners outperform the competition in "real" working environments.

Growing is the most rugged and dirty part of the seed to sale process. Soil can stick to tags and barcodes and make things difficult for scanning and tracking, but a Code barcode reader will scan even the damaged, dirty barcodes with ease.

Production and tracking are imperative parts of the seed-to-sale workflow. Code readers will track inventory, your production process, and can easily be integrated with most any systems and databases.

In the dispensary there are a few factors to consider. You will need scanning for checkout purposes, for age verification, for inventory tracking, for data parsing, etc. Code's cannabis solutions are here to help!
