<h1 style="text-align: center;">OUR SCANNING TECHNOLOGY IS UPGRADING THE WAY YOU HEALTHCARE</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">For 75% of barcode scanning pretty much any barcode scanner will work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But for those where fast, accurate, and reliable scanning of even damaged barcodes makes the difference in quality patient care; for those that need the ability to scan where others simply can’t…</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>There is only Code.</strong></h4>

<h6>POINT-OF-CARE (POC)– NURSING WORKFLOW BEDSIDE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-13536 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Epic-Rover-Partnership-1024x683.jpg" alt="Epic Rover Code Partnership" width="521" height="347" />Medication errors have been identified as one of the largest safety issues in healthcare. The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services estimates that more than 770,000 injuries and deaths occur each year as a result of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) or medication errors in hospitals.

Code is an innovative leader in integrating barcode reading technology into medication administration processes. By electronically matching a drug to patient information through barcoded data prior to administration, clinical productivity, patient safety and quality of care are improved. Today POC workflows are increasingly going mobile with integrated scanning as part of their electronic health records system. <a href="/software/">Code's CortexDecoder was the first integrated soft-scanning solution to kick off this mobile revolution. </a>

Built on a JavaScript platform, Code readers can be quickly configured to work with both enterprise and proprietary Health Information Systems such as: AllScripts (Eclypsis), Epic, Cerner, CPIS, McKesson, Meditech, Siemens, and QuadraMed.

In a healthcare setting, there are countless medical supplies coming in and out every single day. Tracking that inventory is paramount to ensure that the supplies that are needed are always on hand. Code healthcare scanners are the key to your supply tracking needs.

Are your disposable gloves almost out of stock? Need more syringes or hand sanitizer? Setting up a barcode solution with Code can help your hospital maintain a seamless supply chain and workflow. Code's healthcare scanners are built with PVC-free disinfectant-ready CodeShield® plastics, so sterilization is never an issue. Check out the supply tracking scanners below.

</ul>



<h6>TRACK, TRACE, AND VERIFY LAB SAMPLES</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14375 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/track-trace-lab-samples-code-healthcare.jpg" alt="track-trace-lab-samples-code-healthcare" width="347" height="347" />When working with blood, lab cultures, or other specimens, mix-ups can be deadly. When tracking lab samples it is important that the samples are tracked through their entire journey. Using barcode tracking significantly reduces the chances of a potentially hazardous mixup.

Additionally, it is crucial to use sterile equipment in these processes to avoid cross-contamination. Code's CodeShield® plastics can be disinfected by the industry's harshest chemicals making sterilizing a Code scanner is a breeze and won’t damage any of the electronic components. Your lab can work with assurance it is protected and operating at peak efficiency.

<h6>PHARMACY APPLICATIONS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14376 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/data-capture-pharma-code-technologies.jpg" alt="data-capture-pharma-code-technologies" width="520" height="347" />Scanning barcodes on medications is a very involved process. It is necessary to utilize a scanner that can read every barcode thrown at it, on any surface. Drug barcodes can include multiple pieces of information like expiration dates, lot numbers, and the FDA-required National Drug Code (NDC).

Code scanners read all barcode symbologies (even multiple at the same time) and are easily fit into pharmacy work-spaces to scan medication as it leaves. The information on medication labels can then be tracked and read with confidence never worrying if you’ll be able to scan the barcode and get all the information you need when you need it. Code scanners and decoding technology continue to read barcodes that other's simply can't.

Check out the scanners that can be used in your pharmacy application below:
<ul>

 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/">Code Reader™ 2700</a></li>
</ul>



<h6>ADMINISTRATIVE WORKFLOWS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14377 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Healthcare-Admin-data-capture-code-technologies.jpg" alt="Healthcare-Admin-data-capture-code-technologies" width="520" height="347" />A hospital, like any other company, has administrative tasks that need to be completed. Checking patients, vendors, and doctors in and out, payroll, insurance, and the list goes on and on. In a high traffic field like healthcare, it is important to have scanners that are built to keep up.

Code offers scanners that can parse ID and driver license information, omnidirectionally scan any barcode—in any condition, and can read in low-light or situations with high glares. A Code reader will make sure that healthcare admin tasks are always on track. It is time to automate administrative workflow processes to eliminate data entry errors.

<h6>MOBILE SOLUTIONS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-13347 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code_hospital_-CR4300-1024x683.jpg" alt="CR4300 Healthcare use case" width="521" height="347" />Mobile technology is advancing more and more every day. Nurses and clinicians are now finding it beneficial to use mobile devices on the job more for charting, scanning, calls, peer-to-peer messages, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to have a case that protects mobile devices from the harsh medical disinfectants and extends battery power? Code has you covered with PVC-free CodeShield® plastics, Dragontrail™ glass screen protector, and battery backup that doubles phone battery life.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Blood and Saline Bag Scanning</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Blood and saline bag scanning are two complicated workflows in healthcare. Blood bags have 5, 6, or more barcodes printed on the front of them and scanners can find it hard to scan only the information that is needed from the few barcodes that need scanning. Saline bags have the white barcodes printed on the clear bags which is hard for basic scanners to pick up. Code can solve both workflow problems with ease. </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bedside Point of Care</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Point of care at the bedside is the most important workflow in a hospital. Patients need to feel safe and comfortable, and medication administration needs to run smoothly with no mistakes. Code knows bedside care.</span></p>
