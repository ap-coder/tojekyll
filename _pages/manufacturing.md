<h1 style="text-align: center;">OUR SCANNING TECHNOLOGY ENHANCES PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">There are hundreds of moving pieces in any manufacturing process. These variables can alter the quality, safety, efficiency, and bottom line profit margins for companies large and small. Identifying process weak points, monitoring inventory statuses, forecasting production flow, and hundreds of other workflow processes can be tracked — facilitating real-time decision making for management teams nationwide. Data capture makes all this possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Expect More for Manufacturing with Code.</strong></p>

<h6>WORK-IN-PROCESS SOLUTIONS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14604 alignright" src="http://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cr6000-dot-peen-2D-barcode-reading.jpg" alt="cr6000-dot-peen-2D-barcode-reading" width="476" height="340" />Integrating Code barcode readers into a work-in-process application provide visibility throughout each step of production, from tracking the delivery of raw parts and components to logging shipments of manufactured products. The visibility of real-time data ensures both optimal inventory levels and manufacturing lines remain operational.

Code's industrial grade barcode readers are optimized to perform better than any other reader in this market. DPM, laser-etched, embossed, and more are no problem for Code's industrial readers. Reading any barcode from any angle in any environment making Code barcode reading solutions an important part of your work-in-process workflow.

<h6>PRODUCT VERIFICATION</h6>
There are many industries where product verification is a critical requirement. Code’s versatile barcode readers are designed with multiple illumination fields which intuitively select the field that is most efficient at reading each barcode type, so no matter what type of label or coding system you use, you’ll never have to pause to find or select the correct illumination. This in turn will speed up your verification process and save you time and money.

There is a vast array of Code products to use for your verification process purposes. We know how imperative accuracy of verification is — let us help you find the solution that is perfect for your workflow.
