<h2>How do small businesses make themselves shine in the shadow of large retailers?</h2>
<strong><img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/T500-CR5000-clipped.jpg" alt="T500-CR5000-clipped" width="233" height="215" />By getting inventive.</strong> From promotion to point-of-sale, innovating the way they engage customers, crafting the right customer experience will not only get them sharing your brand, but keep them coming back for more. Instead of using the same old technology, resellers can help their customers by offering creative new mobile solutions. The checkout process is a perfect example. Clunky cash registers may functionally meet business requirements, but instead of screaming “cutting edge” or “cool”, they sit there quietly, taking up too much space and reeking of antiquity. Unique consumer mobile devices have really changed the way people look at everything. Phones and tablets are easy-to-use, streamlined computers that can now take the place of that clunky cash register without draining the wallet. Who doesn't want or expect that simple Appleisk experience today when they walk into a store?

In most cases the peripheral options aren’t keeping pace with the computing changes. Resellers and business owners are left with little or no options. Time to check out Code.

Code makes barcode readers. Boring? Not the way our decoding algorithms disrupt the industry. Code is never satisfied with the “same old thing” and constantly working on clever ways to solve customer problems better than anyone else. Why? We are a small business after all ourselves. We know that this gives us the advantage and ability to nimbly keep our finger on the pulse of the industry and our customers changing needs.

<img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/T500-300x300.jpg" alt="T500-in-use" width="213" height="213" />As tablets and phones have become a viable (and often preferred) option for point of sale (POS) use, there is one glaring issue: no ports. How are multiple peripherals going plug in? The barcode solution that many providers came up with was a battery-powered, wireless handheld reader. Well, that’s…ok. But not ideal. It’s functional, but then saddles the retailer with battery costs that they really don’t need not to mention delays for customers if they need to be changed during a purchase.

So Code wondered, how could we connect but not have to add the cost of batteries…what about a wireless wire? Well, kind of. Enter the T500. This flexible cable works with multiple Code readers. It features a built-in Bluetooth module that is powered from a standard AC outlet. So now you have wireless communication to basically any mobile device you want without the added expense of unnecessary batteries. Not rocket science, just super cool ingenuity at its very best that works every time. Need a demo or just want to see how it works?

Let's talk and get your business the tools needed to take you to the next level of mobility.
