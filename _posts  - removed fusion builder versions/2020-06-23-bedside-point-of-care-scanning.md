In the high-stress environment of hospitals, where lives are constantly on the line, patient care and comfort is a constant yet challenging issue. As anyone who has stayed in a hospital well knows, nurses and doctors perform checks, dispense medication, and prescribe treatments at all hours of the day or night. This hectic schedule means that medical specialists need a reliable way to keep track of the constantly changing needs of patients—including medication administration. <strong>Bedside point of care—the process healthcare workers use to organize and dispense medications—is an integral part of any hospital stay.</strong> With Code’s line of patented scanning solutions for the healthcare industry we make just about every aspect of the job easier. From patient safety, comfort, and care–a Code scanning solution is there to help monitor and verify.
<h2>Medication Mistakes and Patient Safety</h2>
The number one safety issue in the healthcare industry is the failure to properly administer medication to patients. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that more than 700,000 injuries and deaths occur each year partially because of this problem. Prescriptions are tricky and require hospital staff to keep track of several key points. Nurses have to make sure they know which person needs medication, the type of medication to give, the amount, and the timing of doses. If any of this information is wrong or the timing of a dose is delayed, patients may experience unnecessary discomfort or pain. Multiply the complexity of medicating one patient by a dozen and you get a sense of how difficult it can be to attend to the constantly changing needs of every patient. Tracking all of this data correctly and maximizing patient care and comfort is possible with the help of barcode scanners.
<h2>Efficiency with Barcodes</h2>
In the pre-digital age, nurses had to physically look up medication information on paper documents, match the information to the patient in question, and then research dosages before administering it. A process that once took an hour has been cut down to mere minutes with barcode readers.

Code readers use unique barcodes to match medically prescribed drugs with the patients who need them. Using integrated software, Code readers keep track of dosages, medication types, and administration frequency so that the hospital staff doesn’t have to. Real-time updates mean that there is a minimized loss of consistency in patient care through shift changes. Healthcare workers can see exactly when the last dose was given, what it was, and when the next one is due—all at their fingertips.
<h2>Code is the Answer</h2>

They can read virtually any barcode used in the healthcare industry including both 1D and 2D barcodes. We use <strong>PVC-free plastic</strong> housings that are disinfectant-ready, which means they are <strong>non-toxic and can survive the harsh chemicals required for sterilizing</strong> medical equipment.

The components inside the plastic feature glare-reduction technology so that barcodes can be effectively read from any surface, at all hours of the day, and in all types of lighting conditions. And no matter what health information system you use, you can integrate our scanners into your system using JavaScript.

For over 20 years, Code has been an industry pioneer, leader, and champion for data capture innovation. By crafting and continuing to perfect its unique decoding algorithms, Code’s scanning technology consistently delivers unparalleled, image-based scanning and decoding performance industries depend on worldwide.

To increase patient comfort and care, let Code’s line of healthcare-dedicated barcode scanning solutions elevate your bedside point of care to a whole new level. <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/healthcare-wins-and-workflow-solutions-include-code-technology">With Code, monitoring and achieving patient safety and comfort is easier than ever before.</a>
