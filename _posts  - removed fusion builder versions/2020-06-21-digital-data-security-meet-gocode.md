It's important that every aspect of your business is secure, even down to the barcodes. You wouldn't keep your retail doors unlocked overnight so anybody could just stroll in and steal all the merchandise or leave your cash register open and unattended, correct? What about patient information? Those little barcodes are a goldmine of information not only important for helping us do our jobs faster and more accurately but they can also pose a security issue. So why would you use a barcode symbology for sensitive data that anybody could copy/read?

Everyone uses security measures to make themselves, their families, their information, and their belongings safe. And businesses should be doing the same with their barcodes!

Did you know that there is a way to utilize a secure barcode that cannot be decoded or copied? Crazy, huh? <strong>Code offers a secure, unique two-dimensional (2D) barcode symbology called <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/gocode-secure-barcode/">GoCode</a>.</strong> If you have a company that is at risk of counterfeiting problems or that just needs advanced security (pharmaceuticals for example), then GoCode might just be what you have been looking for.

Utilizing the GoCode barcode symbology gives the company the benefit of having their own private barcode. How? Well, Code developed this symbology to contain an adaptable matrix pattern that can be reproduced on basically any surface. Cool, I know. Plus these barcodes can be made with user verification features, which means<strong> the data may only be read by approved readers</strong>.

GoCode barcodes have more benefits than just the security (like how your phone does more than just call people). The readability of this code is unparalleled, and as an added bonus it features a multi-resolution matrix that ensures critical data can be retrieved from even the most damaged condition.

One important thing to note, GoCode barcodess are one of the only symbologies that can operate in the space confinement of common text, AND they are the most customizable barcode on the market, meaning it can hold more data within its small size than any other 2D barcode. Have I peaked your security-hungry interest?

With the digital world we live in, data security has moved to the top of virtually every companies priority list and efforts to protect important and sensitive information is at your fingertips. The GoCode symbology can keep your sensitive data safe from any eyes that shouldn't have access and all counterfeiting as well as add a level of extra security everyone will appreciate and thank you for.
