<h2><strong>PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER</strong></h2>
Sometimes, pieces of a puzzle you wouldn’t expect to make a difference become the key to the solution you need. As the COVID-19 virus spread around the world, healthcare organizations began devoting more resources to testing. In a pandemic, the faster physicians can diagnose and begin treatment, the more lives are saved. This makes developing a more accurate and reliable test for the novel coronavirus a high priority.

A world leader in molecular diagnostics, and strategic partner with Code, is on the frontlines of this important task. Working together, we've developed a rapid, near-patient, point-of-care molecular test for detecting the COVID-19 virus.  Code’s CR1500, an image-based barcode scanner designed for the needs of the healthcare community (<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/">https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/)</a> played a key role. For this new testing system, the CR1500 is tethered to the analyzer developed by our partner. The scanner identifies the correct assay and patient, helping to match and track the test and materials throughout the process. Code’s scanner and custom-tailored software ensures the data scanned provides immediate and accurate results
<h2><strong>BENEFITS</strong></h2>
<img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CR1500.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" srcset="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_CR1500.jpg 120w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CR1500.jpg 239w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2_CR1500.jpg 359w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3_CR1500.jpg 478w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4_CR1500.jpg 598w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4_CR1500.jpg 717w" alt="CR1500" width="239" height="181" />The molecular diagnostics company chose the CR1500 scanner for the testing system because of the benefits they deemed critical. Among these is the use of CodeShield® plastics. This proprietary plastic can withstand the harsh medical disinfectants and without degrading. This material will not crack over time or be at risk of damage even with repeated cleanings throughout the day

In addition to industry-leading scanning technology, Code’s ability to customize and their strategic approach to OEM relationships also impacted the decision. Code ensures seamless and consistent integration of the scanning systems needed to support the requirements within the FDA environment. For essential healthcare data such as this, there is no room for error.

As healthcare evolves during this epidemic, choosing the right partner and product means the difference between saving lives and wasting time.
<h2><strong>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</strong></h2>
Additional considerations for choosing the CR1500 included its ergonomic qualities: the unit is lightweight, easy to handle, and fits well in the hand. Durable and well designed, it withstands drops and bumps without damage to the scanning mechanism or glass. With an IP54 rating, the CR1500 resists water and can be rinsed under a faucet if needed. The barcode decoding speed leads the industry and provides first-time, every-time accuracy. The image-based reading ensures that the scanner will be as effective in the future as it is when it first arrives.

Finally, according to our partner, the choice to go with the CR1500 was also based on Code’s responsiveness and flexibility. We make sure that answer questions and that you have access to any help you might need. Building relationships matters as much as selling scanners. We strive for long-term partnerships that help your business become more successful.
