<strong><img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" srcset="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_image-4.png 118w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png 235w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_image-4.png 353w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_image-4.png 470w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_image-4.png 588w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_image-4.png 705w" alt="" width="235" height="176" /></strong>Like peas and carrots, or Sonny and Cher, certain things go together. Barcode scanning supports healthcare’s  performance and makes it even better. How, you might ask? By reducing or eliminating adverse drug events (ADEs), increasing patient safety, and eliminating transcription errors. Government mandates made data capture solutions a necessary part of operations at every healthcare facility. Data capture solutions ensure patient safety through regular checks and documentation. Using unique identifiers (barcodes) attached to patients, medications, equipment, and pretty much every item located in a healthcare setting, facilities save time, money, and add patient security. Cleaning, inventory, and hospitality crews use data capture solutions to track room cleanings, patient nutrition, and equipment maintenance. Those little barcodes perform a very big job.
<h2><strong>So why does it matter?</strong></h2>
It matters because each workflow requires various types of barcode scanners to keep things running efficiently. And despite what you may have been told, <strong>one size does not fit all in scanning.</strong>

Due to the scanner being near to patients, barcode scanners used for hospitals with inpatient bedside medication administration, or emergency departments, receive extra scrutiny by infection control teams. These workflows require a completely sealed barcode scanner that withstands the constant cleaning and sanitizing. Inventory crew scanners don’t require the same sterilization, but they may need to handle multiple barcodes at high speeds at the same time.
<h3>There are three basic types of barcode scanners designed to handle a wide range of tasks:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all">Tethered(attached to a PC)</a></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all">Bluetooth (like your favorite speaker) or</a></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all">Mobile units (can move from room to room)</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>Tethered</strong> units  predominantly get used in clinical workflows like outpatient doctors’ offices, pharmacies, or labs. Generally, tethered units cost less, but their cords often get in the way in an inpatient setting. Inpatient environments are more complex. IVs and cords from monitoring equipment make access to scanning patient wrist bands and medications a challenge.

Bluetooth barcode scanners give clinicians freedom and increase patient interaction. This improves patient safety and satisfaction. However, Bluetooth scanners depend upon a constant connection to a computer.

<strong>Mobile</strong> products put the scanner and computer in one device. They work in the same fashion as Bluetooth units, but they don’t require a PC connection. Mobile scanners run mobile versions of EHR software applications, and several of the mobile EHR applications include built-in barcode reading. This makes the perfect solution for the complicated hospital environment.
<h2><strong>Product-to-environment matching is key when choosing a barcode reader</strong></h2>

The small form factor plus highly reliant Bluetooth makes this perfect for bedside applications.

Code’s mobility product, the <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-7018/">CR7018</a> for iPhone, offers flexibility for various workflows. Be it inpatient bedside or supporting roles like cleaning or hospitality crews, Code built these units with disinfectant-ready plastics. The CR7018 houses the iPhone 7 or 8. Its fully enclosed form factor includes an external swappable battery - we built it to last. It fits perfectly in clinicians’ hands,  and gets rave reviews from customers. It provides healthcare facilities a streamlined option for supporting roles that need to move from room to room.

<a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/healthcare-wins-and-workflow-solutions-include-code-technology">Code barcode scanners continue to be favored in performance, form factor, and durability in healthcare.</a> They not only scan faster, but they accurately decode when others can’t even seem to get started. The patented algorithm powering our decoding technology sets the standard. What does that mean for your workflow? No matter the tiny size, curved surface, color, or damage to the barcode, you get the best results from a Code barcode reader and keep your team moving.

One-size-fits-all scanners never actually do. If you’re unsure where to start, gather information on your team’s workflows and connect with a Code professional.
