<h2><span class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="text">PRESS RELEASE: </span><strong>Make It Easier to Integrate Barcode Scanning?  Done.</strong></h2>


<strong><img title="1000-stand-angle02" class=" wp-image-13095 alignright" src="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1000-stand-angle02.gif" alt="Code Reader 1000" width="263" height="395" />Salt Lake City, UT - February 6, 2019 –</strong> Code, an innovator in healthcare automation and mobile technology, is featuring its <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/">new CR1100 compact barcode reading system</a> at the Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) show in Orlando next week.  The CR1100 features years of healthcare barcode reading experience combined with the latest image processing technology in a tiny package that easily fits into a variety of medical devices.

“The CR1100 is different than most embedded barcode readers because it gives full scanner functionality – reading, audible feedback, plug-and-play interface cables – in the smallest product possible,” said Garrett Russell, Vice President of Marketing and North American Sales.  “Manufacturers have enough to worry about with their own technology, so we made ours stress free for them to integrate.”

For nearly 20 years, Code has dealt with the toughest scanning challenges in hospitals, pharmacies, and labs, reading even the most damaged barcodes when no one else could.  This specialized knowledge has been combined with patented functionality to create the CR1100: a reader well suited for healthcare applications.

Code has taken additional steps to shrink the footprint of the technology without sacrificing performance.  The result is a fully enclosed, super small scanner with integrated mounting features and plug-and-play interface cables to allow medical device manufacturers to add barcode reading functionality to their systems quickly.  A powerful JavaScript platform makes it easy to customize the CR1100 to interface with virtually any host.

“Code has a long history of working closely with device manufacturers to optimize data capture,” said Hong Ji, Program Manager. “The CR1100 continues our dedication to providing flexible solutions for these customers without having them settle for less than the best reading performance.”
