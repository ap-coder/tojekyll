<h2><strong>Barcode Scanning &amp; Manufacturing Go Hand-In-Hand</strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RETAIL-isolated-product-images-copy.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-16056 " title="RETAIL-isolated-product-images copy" src="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RETAIL-isolated-product-images-copy-300x184.png" alt="Retail Product Line" width="338" height="207" /></a>There are literally hundreds of moving pieces in any manufacturing process. These variables affect the quality, safety, efficiency, and bottom line profit margins for companies large and small. Identifying process weak points, monitoring inventory statuses, forecasting production flow, and hundreds of other workflow processes can be tracked and facilitate real-time decision making for management teams nationwide. Data capture makes all this possible.

<strong><em>Code is here to help!</em></strong>
<h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2>
Before there were barcodes, it was a Wild, Wild West of sorts in the world of tracking manufacturing production and workflow. The UPC label didn’t show up as a viable option until the 1970s. Even then, it was mainly used and developed for retail. The first-item ever scanned for purchase by a barcode scanner (which is widely, <u><a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_892778">yet incorrectly</a></u>, believed to be sitting in the Smithsonian) was a 10-pack of Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit chewing gum.

While the introduction of UPC labels ignited the ability for the production and sale of products to become more streamlined and accurate, the UPC label has its limitations. Today’s challenging world of manufacturing offers many more efficient and durable options, but utilizing those options has become an industry in itself.

One of the most notable advancements in manufacturing workflow and efficiency has been Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Though originally designed only for the manufacturing process,  ERP systems today integrate everything from the front office to the warehouse. ERP is the wave of the future, and cloud ERP solutions are consistently leading the way in cost reduction and efficiency.

But even when ERP systems utilize high-quality, data-rich barcodes that house vital inventory and workflow information, companies still need a way to scan, track, and manage that information. <strong>For many operations, thousands of scans are happening on a daily—if not hourly—basis.</strong> Scanning all those different barcodes quickly and correctly, even when the barcodes are damaged, reflective, or warped, is a big undertaking that has the potential to slow down productivity. That’s why Code has developed quality scanning solutions that you can trust to transfer all the correct information into your ERP system without any hiccups.
<h2><strong>Code Solutions</strong></h2>
<strong>Code has spent years relentlessly researching, developing, and producing highly-durable scanning solutions powered by the industries most aggressive decoding algorithm</strong> <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/manufacturing/">for the needs of your manufacturing operation.</a> With Code’s versatile solutions that won’t break the bank, it’s easy to understand why Code is a recommended choice for those in the automotive, aerospace, semiconductor, electronic assembly, and other industries. <strong>We’re confident you will find a superior solution in our line of manufacturing-dedicated scanners.</strong>
<h2><strong>Go Wireless</strong></h2>
If you need a wireless scanning solution, our Bluetooth-enabled <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2600/">CR2600 XHD</a> is built to scan the first time (every time) while still being able to withstand the gambit of harsh conditions your facility throws at it. And with the capacity to scan up to 50,000 times on a single charged battery, <em>you’ll likely need a break before it does.</em>

Dropped your scanner on a concrete floor? Dropped it again? And again? No sweat. Our products can survive multiple drops to concrete. Our high-quality plastic housings are also sealed to protect the inner components from particles and harsh cleaning chemicals.
<h2><strong>Tethered Power</strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CR950-front2.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-16137 size-medium" title="CR950-front2" src="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CR950-front2-205x300.png" alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a>When you don’t want to worry about a scanner “running away,” we have a robust line of tethered options, which includes the <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/">CR1100 XHD</a>, <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/">CR1500 IND</a>, and <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-6000/">CR6000 DPM</a>.

The CR1000 XHD and CR1500 IND come ready to scan whatever you throw at them with their high-density fields and built-in macro lenses. In short, that means <em>you can scan tiny barcodes with laser precision. </em>

Got a wide array of barcodes that require different illumination? The CR6000 DPM intuitively identifies the correct illumination for reading your label and makes the adjustment automatically. You’ll never need to manually find or select the correct illumination.
<h2><strong>Product Use Examples</strong></h2>
Below are some of the most common examples of how Code surpasses the competition and will improve your workflow efficiency.
<h2><strong>Work-in-Process and Supply Chain Management</strong></h2>
In many cases, the most vulnerable parts of an operation are within the realms of work-in-process and supply chain management. Incorrect data entry can cause unnecessary delays in your supply chain, and the efficiency of your entire operation can get bogged down if you don’t have up-to-date information on materials as they flow through the production process.

When integrated into your ERP or work-in-process application, Code barcode solutions can provide a transparent overview of every step. Not only will your production run smoother, but Code can implement automatic inventory management solutions so you can manage inventory without worrying about stock levels or initiating reorders.
<h2><strong>Dot Peen and Beyond</strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dot-peen.png"><img class="wp-image-16858 size-medium" src="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dot-peen-300x215.png" alt="dot peen" width="300" height="215" /></a>

Do you or your suppliers or clients use intricate laser-etched or dot peen codes? Do you also need to scan incoming and outgoing shipments? Code scanners are built specifically to handle the vast array of barcodes used in every aspect of the manufacturing industry.

Do your barcodes occasionally come into your facility damaged or warped? That’s not a problem. Code can scan them. <strong>Code scans and decodes any type of barcode (over 42 different types) with unique image based decoding algorithms that compensate for less than ideal conditions and environments.</strong> Pretty impressive to watch the speed and accuracy first hand! Below are a few of the more common types of barcodes found in the manufacturing industry that our scanners decode with lightning speed:
<ul>
 	<li>1D (ex. retail barcodes)</li>
 	<li>2D (ex. data matrix/QR codes)</li>
 	<li>Postal</li>
 	<li>Color</li>
 	<li>Low-contrast</li>
 	<li>Laser-etched</li>
 	<li>High-density</li>
 	<li>Dot peen</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Track and Trace</strong></h2>
Does your production process span multiple locations or even operate worldwide? When you are shipping and receiving items from one location to another, it’s essential to have a quick and easy solution for facility workers to be able to scan, track, and trace shipments as they happen. The unmatched scan engine inside all of Code’s DPM barcodes makes it easy to keep a clean and current record of all inventory no matter where it is located.
<h2><strong>Product Verification</strong></h2>
Running an efficient operation usually involves some level of product verification. There is a vast array of barcode options that you can use for your product verification purposes. Code scanners feature multiple illumination fields that will intuitively select the field that will read your barcode type most efficiently. So no matter what type of label or coding system you use, you’ll never have to pause to find or select the correct illumination. Your verification process will speed up as a result, saving you time and money.
<h2><strong>Mobile Application</strong></h2>
In addition to Bluetooth and tethered scanning options, Code's also offers a software based scanning solution through its software brand <a href="https://tachyoniq.com/">TachyonIQ</a>. The same enterprise-grade scanning and decoding power embedded in our hardware scanners in now packaged together in a SDK and available for mobile application integration. Two SDK options are available <a href="https://tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/cortexdecoder-2/">CortexDecoder</a> for consumer mobile devices based applications and <a href="https://tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/edgedecoder-2/">EdgeDecoder</a> for more OEM applications.  These SDKs can turn your teams smartphones into enterprise-grade barcode scanning devices with all the same function and scanning ability dedicated scanning hardware offers. Now, when you’re away from the office, you can still scan a wide variety of barcodes using only your smartphone camera, instantly transferring that information into your ERP system or supply chain management application.
<h2><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2>
No product is worth anything until it arrives at the client’s door, and the barcodes are always in the most perfect condition right? Code scanners again can come to the rescue with the ability to compensate for damage and are built to scan a long list of symbologies including postal barcodes. You can also utilize our scan-to-print functionality to scan and print labels for your shipping needs. <em>Code scanners work seamlessly with your shipping operation to monitor delivery schedules and aid in delivering shipments on time to the correct locations. </em>
