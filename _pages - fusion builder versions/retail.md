<h1 style="text-align: center;">MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY, SPEED UP CHECKOUT LINES, AND TRACK INVENTORY WITH EASE</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Thin margins and high employee turnover are some of the biggest hurdles in the retail industry. Running a successful retail operation means that workflow systems must be cost-efficient and easy to use. Barcodes were literally invented to make the retail industry more efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Today there are solutions all across the board to help your retail business run smoothly, <strong>but none offer the same level of affordability and reliability as the solutions Code has created.</strong></p>

<h6>POINT OF SALE WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14552 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cr950_and_stand-retail.jpg" alt="CR950 POS Code Readers" width="455" height="303" /> Code barcode readers have been designed to maximize productivity in a retail environment. With a focus on quick scanning and durability, Code barcode reading solutions can easily be integrated into all point-of-sale (POS) solutions.

Code offers a full line of tethered and wireless readers that are compact, rugged, and feature a high-performance scan engine that makes barcode reading extremely fast and reliable. Code barcode readers have significantly reduced power requirements, thus limiting the battery drain on POS systems and reducing overall costs when deployed throughout your operation. Additionally, Code readers are designed to be ready to use, right out of the box for seamless integration with any POS system, network, and information system.

Code readers are rich with patented technologies to give retailers the best return on their investment. Code’s anti-glare reducing technology makes reading barcodes on shiny surfaces, mobile devices, or curved surfaces, quick and easy, while the dual-field optics of a Code reader allow users to read both 1D and 2D barcodes with the same device.

To further enhance customer service and increase efficiency, Code readers can be used as either a hand-held scanner or in hands-free mode, and are compact and lightweight enough to be carried continuously on the retail floor or warehouse.

</ul>



<h6>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT MADE EASY</h6>
A dependable inventory management system is essential to the profitability of any business. Speed is crucial to any business. Quality control and quick turnaround of products receipt to order fulfillment is crucial to any business. A device that can assist with all of these components should be crucial to any business.

Code barcode readers should be a key component in any business' inventory control process. All of Code readers are engineered to out-perform and out-read the competitions'. From reading barcodes that are very small, to very large printed on shiny or curved surfaces to poorly printed barcodes; all foundational hurdles Code has engineered to succeed. Featuring a JavaScript platform, Code readers can handle the data parsing and integration into any enterprise solution.

Code barcode readers can simplify supply chain and distribution management by reading all 1D and 2D barcodes, assist in inventory counts, inventory location and alerting users to when re-ordering or re-stocking is needed.

From tethered to wireless, Code has a barcode reading solution to fit any inventory management need.

<h6>MOBILE COUPONS AND TICKETING</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14551 alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CR5000-RETAIL-761X551.jpg" alt="CR5000 Retail Code Readers" width="449" height="325" />For many retailers, mobile devices are a new channel to reach customers. To meet the demands of this growing market, Code has developed feature rich, patented barcode reading solutions that are ideal for reading QR Code, PDF417 and other barcoded coupons and tickets directly from the screen of virtually any mobile device.

Mobile screens and other shiny surfaces can reflect both the illumination and ambient light, back into the barcode reader, rendering the barcode unreadable. Code barcode readers are the only 2D Area Imagers in the industry that are equipped with a patented glare and reflection reducing technology that will significantly increase read rates in these environments. Additionally, Code readers feature intuitive, omnidirectional barcode reading that will make a barcode readable from any angle. Code readers can be used in either hands-free or handheld modes and can be combined with various peripherals for truly unique solutions.

The lightweight and ergonomic design of Code readers reduce fatigue when being used for extended periods of time, and the high-performance scan engine in Code readers ensure that coupons and tickets can be read in a snap, without slowing down the checkout process.

Consider these products for your mobile coupons and ticketing workflow:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-950/">Code Reader™ 950</a></li>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/">Code Reader™ 1100</a></li>

To protect businesses from age verification infractions, Code has designed the CR5000, an easy-to-use, out of the box, age verification solution that combines reliable 2D barcode reading with advanced data parsing capabilities.
