<p style="text-align: center;">PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>


Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 5/15/2017

INTRODUCTION:

This privacy policy applies to www.codecorp.com, xx.codecorp.com, www.codeisv.com, CortexID and other websites and platforms operated by The Code Corporation and or its affiliated companies (the "Platforms”) The Code Corporation and our affiliated companies (referred to collectively "Code" or "we"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. We understand the importance of providing you with information concerning how we collect, use and protect personal information provided by you and/or collected by Code.

COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:

"Personal Information" is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person or business entity. Examples of personal information include a personal name or company name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

We collect Personal Information when you elect to provide such information to us, such as when you register for or use one or more of the Platforms, request additional information from us about our products and services, enter a contest or promotion, or submit an email to us. We also collect Personal Information in conjunction with providing our products and services, including maintenance and support thereof. We use Personal Information to provide you with the information, products or services that you have requested and, if applicable, charging you for the products or services you have ordered. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also disclose Personal Information with our affiliates as well as other companies with which we have relationships in order to provide you with the information, products or services which you have requested. We may use Personal Information to provide important notices regarding our products and services. We may use Personal Information for internal purposes such as helping us develop, deliver and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. We may also enlist third parties to collect, store, process and manage Personal Information for Code. The third parties with whom we conduct business are authorized to use Personal Information only to perform the service for which they are hired. When we use other companies to perform services on our behalf, we will require that such companies protect your Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

In addition, from time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to receive information, products or services directly from a third party. If you elect to receive such items, we may share your Personal Information as necessary to facilitate your request to receive items from any such third-party.

We may process or store your Personal Information in our systems and databases located in the United States or any other country where Code operates.

We may disclose Personal Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Term of Use or other agreements with Code, causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) any of our Platforms, products, services or other rights or property. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, such as a subpoena and for other governmental administrative, regulatory or law enforcement purposes.

If Code is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

COLLECTION AND USE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

"Financial Information" is information consisting of financial qualifications and billing information provided in conjunction with purchasing Code products and services. Examples include a customer’s billing name and address, or credit card number.

Except as explicitly stated at the time we request the information, or as provided in any agreement between you and Code, we do not disclose to third parties the Financial Information provided. All Financial Information that we collect is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the products or services. Such information is not used by Code for marketing or promotional purposes. Code uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing (we do not retain credit card numbers).

INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ("CUSTOMER DATA”).

Code may collect information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer or patron of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

Access and Retention of Data Controlled by our Customers Code has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of Code’s customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the customer of Code, the data controller. If requested by the customer to remove data we will respond within 30 days.

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customer and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Thereafter personal data that we process on behalf of our customers may be retained solely for archival and statistical purposes.

USER ACCESS AND CHOICE (DOES NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER DATA):

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend or delete it by emailing our Customer Support at support @codecorp.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Thereafter your personal data may be retained solely for archival and statistical purposes.

When we use your email address to send you promotional or marketing emails, out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving these marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at support@codecorp.com.

COLLECTION AND USE OF ANONYMOUS INFORMATION:

We may collect information in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual ("Anonymous Information"). For example, we may track the number of visitors to our web site by logging Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the type of browser software used, and the date and web pages which are viewed. We use Anonymous Information so we can monitor usage and improve the performance of our web site. Also, we may pay attention to what visitors do and do not use on our web site in order to assess the effectiveness of our web site and modify our content or design appropriately.

All Anonymous Information shall be solely owned by Code and may be used and disclosed by Code for any lawful purpose. Provided however, if to the extent IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we handle these identifiers as Personal Information. In any combination of Anonymous Information with Personal Information, the combined information is treated as Personal Information.

STATISTICAL INFORMATION:

We may use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as the basis for calculating demographic, economic and other statistical information about usage of our products and services and about our industry and the industries in which our customers participate ("Statistical Information"). All Statistical Information shall be solely owned by Code and may be used and disclosed for any lawful business purpose, provided however, Statistical Information that includes Personal Information or which could be used to derive Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.

SECURITY:

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information and the information on our Platforms from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Code cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail or via other web sites, and you do so at your own risk.

Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access any of our Platforms, which you select at registration, should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate web sites that are linked to or from our web site you may be disclosing your Information, and different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your Information. We encourage you to review these web sites' policies before revealing any sensitive Information. Code is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these web sites.

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. While we strive to protect your information by employing reasonable internet security methods and practices, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us over an unsecured Internet connection. If you have any questions about our security please contact us at info@codecorp.com.

USE OF COOKIES:

As is standard practice on many commercial web sites, Code's web sites use "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser software from a web server and is typically stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We only use persistent cookies. These are cookies that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We may insert cookies on your computer and access those cookies. These cookies store and use Personal Information to help you navigate through our web site and to provide you with customized and personalized features. Cookies may also assist us in collecting Anonymous Information.

Additionally, we may allow other companies to present advertisements on some pages on our web site, and we may allow those companies to set and access their own cookies on your computer in connection with such advertising. Those other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.

If you would like to disable cookies, check with the provider of your browser to find out how to disable cookies.

CLICK-THROUGH URLS:

In some of our email messages we may use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Code web site. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

CHILDREN:

Code's Platforms are not directed at individuals less than eighteen (18) years of age, and Code does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such information is collected. If a child under 18 submits Personal Information to Code and we learn that such Personal Information is the information of a child under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

TESTIMONIALS:

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at support@codecorp.com.

THIRD PARTY WEB SITES:

Our site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Code. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit.

UPDATES:

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new uses, rules, regulations or technologies that impact your privacy. We will post those updates here or in other formats for you to review. Changes to this Privacy Policy will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy, as well as to existing information held by us. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. If we change our information practices or this Privacy Policy in such a way that your personal information may be used or shared in a manner not described in the Privacy Policy at the time you provided it, you may provide us notice (at the address below) that you would like to opt-out of having your information used or shared in such new manner. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices. We recommend that you review our Privacy Policy on a routine basis to view any changes.
