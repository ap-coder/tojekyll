<p style="text-align: center;">YOUR FORM HAS BEEN DELIVERED!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">At Code, customer service really does mean something! We just received your form in our inbox and have just sent you anÂ email back! If you could take just a second to verify the request you made, we can get everything entered into our system and you off to the right person with the right answers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Like you, we get a ridiculous amount of spam and bot junk we must filter through (by that I mean delete!). The simple step of verifying your form information rockets your request up to the top! We thank you again for your interest in Code.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your Code Web Team</p>
