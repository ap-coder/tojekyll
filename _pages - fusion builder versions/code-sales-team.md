<h1 style="text-align: center;">READY TO TALK SALES?<br />
SO ARE WE!</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">It is really no secret. The incredible decoding technology harnessed by each Code barcode reader and scan module consistently displace others in the market. How?  By simply performing better, delivering customization in data parsing, and just scanning barcodes other's can't. Since we don't sell our products direct, by reaching out to the sales manager in your area (listed below with photos of their smiling faces), we will gladly walk you through the process, point you in the right direction, or help you get the product you want from a reseller you already have a relationship with.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>At Code, we strive for service that is over and above, we don't just sell barcode readers–we provide solutions.</strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>We value your business and your recommendation!</strong></h4>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">AT CODE WE ARE HERE TO HELP, OUR 98% CUSTOMER SUCCESS RATE STARTS HERE!</h6>
<p style="text-align: center;">No matter where you are at in the process we can help make sure you have the right barcode scanning solution for your workflow. Be it hardware or mobile software based scanning solutions, we can answer your questions and help navigate the way.</p>


<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 55px;">The Right Tools For The Right Solution. Every Time.</span></h4>
