<h1 style="text-align: center;">START BUILDING WITH CODE SCANNING TECHNOLOGY</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">We understand that scanning doesn't always need to come in the form of a handheld scanner. For instances where you just want the scanning power without the housing, Code’s line of small, high-performance scan engines is perfect for your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) applications. Our OEM solutions can be integrated into mobile or fixed applications, making it easy to find a solution that’s right for you.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Expect More with Code.</strong></h4>

<h6>HEALTHCARE LAB AND DIAGNOSTIC SOLUTIONS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14670 alignright" src="http://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lab-diagnostic-oem.jpg" alt="OEM laboratory diagnostic scan modules " width="417" height="278" />Code's scan engines combine advanced imaging technology with features that are ideal for the healthcare environment. The patented anti-glare technology, dual-field optics and snappy reading of all 1D and 2D barcodes are why Code is a technology leader in this environment. These engines are compact and sized ideally to be integrated into multiple medical OEM product platforms.

If you have a OEM devices in your medical labs, you need scanning that you can trust. Every scan in healthcare is mission critical, which is why you need Code.

Consider these products for your healthcare workflow:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/">Code Reader™ 1100</a></li>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/scan-engines/">Code Reader™ 8200</a></li>
</ul>



<h6>KIOSKS, VENDING MACHINES, SELF-CHECKOUT &amp; MORE</h6>

Customers can scan and go quickly and easily, which will make them happier and make your business run smoother.

The aggressive decoding capabilities of Code’s scan engines are unmatched in scanning performance directly from mobile devices, as well as dense and damaged barcodes. The motion detection, continuous scan, and omnidirectional features combined with the compact size make Code scan engines ideal for self-service kiosks and terminals.

Consider these products for your kiosks and vending:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/cr-1100/">Code Reader™ 1100</a></li>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/scan-engines/">Code Reader™ 8200</a></li>
</ul>



<h6>MOBILITY TERMINALS</h6>
<img class=" wp-image-14672 alignright" src="http://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oem-mobile-terminals.jpg" alt="oem-mobile-terminals" width="417" height="278" />Have a mobile computer system that could use built-in, high-performing scanning? Code's aggressive scan engines may be small in size, but they are huge in functionality.

For integration, a variety of mounting options are available including tabs, blind through holes, and mounting brackets for both the scan engine and the decode board. Code engines draw significantly less current and get into and out of its low power state faster than any other imaging-based scan engine. These two items are critical when integrating the engine into a mobile device, better power management from the imager equates to longer battery life for mobile devices.

Consider these products for your mobile terminal:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="/portfolio-items/scan-engines/">Code Reader™ 8200</a></li>
</ul>
