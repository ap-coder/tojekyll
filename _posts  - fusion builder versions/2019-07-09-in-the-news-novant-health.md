Serving communities across the Southeast, Novant Health is a multi-state integrated network of physician clinics, outpatient centers and hospitals that delivers a seamless healthcare experience to its community members. The Novant Health network consists of nearly 30,000 team members who provide care at 640 locations, including 15 medical centers and hundreds of outpatient facilities and physicians clinics. Headquartered in North Carolina, Novant Health serves more than five million patients annually.

<strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code’s CortexDecoder is a software-based barcode scanning solution</a></strong> that was chosen for integration into Epic Rover because it provides users enterprise-grade, barcode scanning strength – using only the camera on an iOS device. CortexDecoder can scan over 40 different barcode symbologies, allowing healthcare workers to seamlessly move from one workflow to another.

Novant is seeing excellent acceptance and integration of the technology. Software-enabled barcode scanning of patient wristbands to access medical records coupled with the ability to scan and verify medications helps to significantly reduce errors and improve patient safety – making soft-scanning a huge win for both the medical staff and their patients.
