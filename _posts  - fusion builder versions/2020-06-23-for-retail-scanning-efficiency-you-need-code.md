<h2>Barcode Scanning and Retail... Two Peas in a Pod</h2>
Thin margins and high employee turnover are some of the biggest hurdles in the retail industry. Running a successful retail operation means that workflow systems must be cost-efficient and easy to use. Code barcode scanning solutions are competitively affordable and user friendly—but it doesn’t stop there. Driven by the sincere desire to exceed expectations, each scanner is also protected by a durable, lightweight plastic external housing and powered by enterprise-level scanning technology on the inside. For over 20 years, Code has been an industry pioneer, leader, and champion for data capture innovation and it shows. Code’s industry innovating product portfolio includes both hardware and software image-based data capture solutions that spotlight its unique bundle of powerful decoding algorithms. Picking the right data capture technology for your retail barcode scanning needs eliminates many of the workflow efficiency struggles that seem to devour time and resources.
<h2>Barcodes in Retail</h2>
Barcodes were literally invented to make the retail industry more efficient. However, the first UPC label showed up much later than you might imagine. It wasn’t until the 70's that the first item (a pack of gum) was marked with a barcode and scanned for a customer to purchase. In the last 40 years, technology has come a long way in improving how barcodes help retail businesses.
Today there are solutions all across the board to help your retail business run smoothly, but none offer the same level of affordability and reliability as the solutions Code has created.
<h2>Code's Data Capture Solutions</h2>

<strong>Wireless</strong>

When you need your barcode scanning to be truly mobile and versatile, and really deliver that appleisk modern look and feel, consider using a keyboard scanning wedge. Code's scanning technology has been configured and deployed inside an app that is easily downloadable and installed on any mobile device you choose. Once installed you select the field you want the barcode data scanned into, switch your devices keyboard out with the CortexWedge scanning keyboard and click scan.

Since the scanning wedge is a soft-scanning product Code sells it under the TachyonIQ brand name. Test it out for your self and receive 50 free scans. CortexWedge is a SaaS product and will require a license for each device it's deployed on.

<strong>Tethered</strong>

<img class="alignright" src="https://www.codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cr950__cabled_01.png" alt="" width="276" height="276" />When you need your scanner to stay put or just need to use it in a designated area, the CR950, CR1100, and CR5000 solutions offer convenient hand-held or hands-free options.

If cost is your deciding factor, the CR950 is our most affordable option. But don’t let the price fool you, this scanner is still the soul of an eagle in the body of a hummingbird—a powerful and efficient engine in a sleek and compact case. The CR950 features all of the scanning ability and speed you need without any extra bulk.

Sticking with the animal comparisons, the CR1000 is a wolf in sheep’s clothing—on the outside it’s lightweight and features and ergonomic, hand-held design, but on the inside it’s built to tear through any barcodes you throw at it with lightning speed and laser precision.

Lastly, the CR5000 is the stallion of our tethered options. With all of the features of the other scanners, this high-powered, presentation scanner also allows you to scan government-issued IDs and driver licenses to verify age.

It’s Friday night. You’re headed to grab pizza to bring home for the family. Suddenly you realize you forgot to put in an inventory order for Monday. You know stock is low, but you aren’t sure how low. You detour back to the office to get it taken care of and end up bringing home cold pizza

will run smoother as a result. The nitty gritty details of inventory management will be one less thing on your plate, which means more room on your plate for pizza.

<strong>Retail Pharmacy</strong>

Conquer all of your pain points such as POS, drug verification, and inventory management using Code scanners. Your pharmacy will run more efficiently—reducing medication dispensing errors—and customers and employees alike will experience higher levels of satisfaction.

It’s no secret that drug containers come in all shapes and sizes and are mostly cylindrical. In addition to variable container sizes, barcodes that track the drug contents and information also come in various types and sizes. All of those variables can lead to a headache when it comes to scanning and tracking everything quickly and accurately in your pharmacy. With Code barcode scanners, you’ll never have to scan something multiple times or worry about incorrect information being read from difficult, damaged, or curved barcodes. With a single scan, Code readers will analyze the data and integrate it into your existing system.

Code scanners also feature high-durability plastic housings that protect the interior components from impact, dust, and liquid—including harsh cleaning agents. In a pharmacy where sanitation is crucial, you can rest easy knowing Code scanners won’t be damaged or break down by disinfectants.

<strong>Mobile Coupons and Ticketing</strong>

We’ve all been there—waiting in line for a concert or sporting event with digital tickets in hand hoping the QR code on our phone screen will scan at the gate. Not only do mobile tickets and coupons reduce paper usage, they are increasingly becoming the norm in our mobile-enabled world. There is no escaping the digital ticketing future.

Code has earned a place at the top of the barcode scanning industry when it comes to speed, accuracy, and reliability. If you have thousands of people to get through a ticketing gate, every second counts.

And with omnidirectional scanning capabilities and patented glare-reducing technology, ticket holders won’t have to contort the angle of their phone until it’s juuuuust right. Tickets will scan at any angle on any screen.

Code is serious about protecting the integrity and longevity of your business. In the world of age verification, any error in scanning state—or government-issued identifications could mean a hefty fine, damaged reputation, or loss of business license. Why risk it? Code offers reliable, fast-reading solutions that make it easy for you to capture and verify age information without error. In addition, complying with the law may require you to store time-stamped data. Code’s scanning solutions have your back and allow you to store information without specialized software to keep your business compliant.
