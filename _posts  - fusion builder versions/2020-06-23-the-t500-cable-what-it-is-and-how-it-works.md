Mobile devices have not only changed the way we communicate but also the way we live our lives. They are our calendars, calculators, notepads, navigation devices, pedometers, budget organizers and so much more. <strong>The technology that can fit in our pockets is progressing to a point where we start to wonder, what can’t our mobile devices do?</strong>
<div class="section post-body">

Many businesses use a smartphone or tablet to run a point of sale (POS) or enterprise application. While consumer devices are a cost effective alternative to a traditional point of sale terminal, they are often designed with limited or zero USB ports. This makes it impossible to plug in a barcode reader, which requires business owners to work around the problem with expensive battery-powered, wireless scanners.

<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-product-accessories/#cables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code has a better solution: the T500 Cable. </a><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-product-accessories/#cables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" srcset="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 118w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 235w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2_9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 353w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3_9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 470w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4_9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 588w, https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4_9588_CODE_360_T500__0004_5.jpg 705w" alt="T500-Cable" width="235" height="221" /></a><strong>The T500 enables Code wired barcode readers to communicate to virtually any mobile device, including: iPad, Galaxy Tab, and Windows Surface, </strong>along with other devices that lack the USB and RS232 ports found on legacy PC-based POS systems. And because the T500 draws power directly from a standard AC wall outlet, battery replacement is a non-factor.
<h2>How it Works</h2>
Until now, cable options for wired barcode readers have been limited to USB or RS232 communication and were plugged directly into a port on a host device. Because the T500 cable has an embedded modem, when plugged into a Code wired barcode reader and powered on, it allows the reader to communicate to other Bluetooth-enabled devices via radio waves.

You also don’t have to worry about recharging the Code reader, because it plugs right into the wall! Nice, right?

<strong>When you’re ready for a cost effective, rock-solid solution for wireless communication in your fast-paced environment, the T500 is more than ready to keep up.</strong>
