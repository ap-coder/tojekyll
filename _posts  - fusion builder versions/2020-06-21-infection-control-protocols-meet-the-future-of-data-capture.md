<h2>WELCOME TO THE FUTURE</h2>
The modern healthcare system features miraculous advancements in technology, treatments, and methods of healing. The equipment used to diagnose and treat patients has changed radically in just the past 50 years. Doctors now can look at the human body in ways that could previously only be imagined on Star Trek. Every day, medical science brings us closer to curing everything from cancer to the common cold.

Much of this advancement directly results from a greater understanding of pathogens, contamination, and proper sterilization techniques. Some of these practices have only been around for the last 20 years or so. It seems unbelievable that much of our medical knowledge and healthcare procedures came into practice in the last few decades. Thankfully, we have better sterilization and reduced contamination in hospitals and healthcare facilities now. In order to maintain these gains in quality care, medical facilities have to remain vigilant.  Protecting against accidental transfer, contamination, or spreading bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms remains the top priority.

Cleaners and disinfectants remain the most effective tool in the sterilization process. Hospitals, clinics, care centers, and offices rely on these chemical solutions for protecting the safety of staff and patients . Protocols developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html</a>) established standards for ensuring that contamination isn’t spread by people, equipment, instruments, or materials used in medical facilities. These standards are required of every medical facility in the United States. The protocols help keep patients safe and healthy during their visit, regardless of how long it may be.

However, disinfectants and cleaners are made of harsh chemicals, and some equipment doesn't hold up well to even one use. A daily routine and possibly multiple exposures to these compounds can cause degradation. Because of the costs for replacing equipment, some healthcare professionals are tempted (or even encouraged) to minimize sterilization practices. Unfortunately, this <img class="alignright" src="https://codecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/STAT_China_Wuhan_COVID-19_coronavirus_49530315718_f467f93628_3k.jpg" alt="Disease modelers gaze into computers to see future of Covid-19 - STAT" width="255" height="200" />increases the risk of cross contamination. Hospitals have reported a rise in health issues such as Staph infections, MRSA, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E coli, </em>salmonella, and Clostridium sordellii. Increases in hospital-acquired infections (HAI) directly relate to failure to follow CDC protocols. These infections can lead to increased hospital stays, increased medications, possible surgical intervention, or even patient death.
<h2>SHORT CUTS DON'T HELP</h2>
Many hospitals go to extreme lengths to stay compliant with regulations, even disregarding manufacturer suggestions for cleaning equipment. Staff members often take short-cuts, even risking the integrity of the equipment. Soaking smaller implements in the harsh cleaning and disinfecting chemicals tempts many nurses in the fast-paced medical environment. A lot of equipment falls victim to the chemicals meant to help hospitals maintain a safer environment. Cleaners and disinfectants cause degredation to plastic and metal, shortening the lifespan of the equipment and increasing facility costs. Finding a product resistant to the damage caused by disinfectants and cleaners would mean a better bottom line. Let us introduce you to one of those resistant products: the CR2700 is built specifically for the healthcare community and offers a number of features that launch us far ahead of the competition (<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/">https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/</a>).

<h2>CR2700 - PURPOSE BUILT FOR HEALTHCARE</h2>
The CR2700 was purpose-built for healthcare, down to it's CodeShield housing. Its design makes it naturally the perfect fit for nurses, CNAs, and those with varied workflows. Small enough to fit in scrub pockets, the CR2700 moves easily from room to room. It's perfect for point-of-care activities like patient verification and medication administration.

When you compare the CR2700 against leading competitors, it becomes obvious why Code is the vendor of choice for many healthcare providers. Our competitors can’t match the on-point benefits that the CR2700 has to offer. Compare for yourself and you’ll see that we excel on every key point (and some of the smaller points, too).
