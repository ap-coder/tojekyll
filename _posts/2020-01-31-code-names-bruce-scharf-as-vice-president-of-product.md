In this role, Scharf will be responsible for setting strategy, scaling product teams and developing the roadmap for future Code products, markets and technologies.

“Bruce’s experience in innovating, building teams and product design in a rapidly evolving marketplace will be a tremendous asset to Code,” said Kent Hansen, CEO of Code Corporation. “We have an incredibly bright future and I am very pleased to bring on such a visionary leader with the skill, technical knowledge and industry passion to meet the needs of our growing customer base by bringing more cutting-edge products and solutions to life.”
