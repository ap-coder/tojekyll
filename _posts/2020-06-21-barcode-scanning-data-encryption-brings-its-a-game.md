Lotteries have been big business for decades, not only in the US, but around the globe. In the US alone in 2016, adults spent $72.7 billion on lottery tickets of all kinds. With jackpots reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars, lottery fever catches people from all walks of life, and people will go to extreme lengths to try to cheat the system. Every day, millions of people hand over hard-earned money for a chance at wealth, and every day, thousands of others scheme ways to defraud the system. In both cases, the lure of instant wealth (or even just an extra 20 bucks), draws folks to play some form of a lottery ticket.
<h2>And so it Goes...</h2>
Lottery history follows an interesting and winding path. The American colonies used lotteries to gain financial footing and bank role a young, growing nation. Gaming revenue also helped construction of railroads across the continent in the 19th century. Lotteries fell out of favor at the beginning of the 20th century in both the US and Europe, with countries restricting them or banning them outright and remaining that way until after World War II. Today, however, many state education budgets in the US receive between 5 and 30 percent of their budget (or more) from lottery earnings.

In October 2002, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL) created a set of technical standards for lotteries across North America to protect the integrity, security, interoperability, and profitability of those operations. In Europe, The European Lotteries (EL) is the umbrella organization of national lotteries operating games of chance for the public benefit. EL brings together state-owned and private operators, both profit and non-profit, who operate on behalf of the state. These bodies help ensure gaming operates ethically and efficiently for the benefit of those who chose to play.
<h2>Barcode Scanning Decreases Fraud</h2>
Among recent changes to lotteries around the globe, the addition of barcodes and barcode scanning technology leads the way as a deterent to fraud. A majority of lottery tickets are now printed with barcode technology that ensures the accuracy of the information on the ticket and protects against counterfeiting and any attempts at altering the ticket. The use of QR codes, 1D, and 2D barcodes has helped to decrease fraud as well as to increase efficiency in the lottery arena. Barcodes printed on all types of lottery tickets, from scratchers to Megabucks disuade would-be criminals and protect ticket authenticity. Because of the amount and types of data which can be encrypted in barcodes, and the safety of the encryption within those barcodes, they have become a nearly ubiquitous part of all types of lotteries.

Omnidirectional scanners, either hand-held or incorporated into the transaction register or terminal, ensure quick (typically milliseconds) reading of the ticket data which is instantly transmitted to the government or private organization responsible for overseeing the lottery ticket sales. For instant win tickets, the data scanned in the barcode can be compared against the lottery list of winning numbers for an immediate yes or no answer and identify where the ticket was sold. These registers or terminals can be found at lottery retailers such as convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, and lottery locations.
