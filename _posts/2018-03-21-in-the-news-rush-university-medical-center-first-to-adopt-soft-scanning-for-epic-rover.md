<strong>Salt Lake City, UT – March 21, 2018 –</strong> Code, a healthcare industry innovator and leader in image-based barcode scanning technology, is adding to its impressive, market-leading healthcare product portfolio with an industry first, <strong>“mobile HIS barcode soft-scanning</strong>”. Code is excited to announce that <a href="https://www.rush.edu/"><strong>Rush University Medical Center</strong>,</a> the Chicago based five star CMS rated academic medical center, is the first hospital system in the world to use CortexDecoder for Epic Rover.  Rush began using the technology this month.

<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/software/">Code’s CortexDecoder is a soft-scanning solution</a> that was chosen for integration into Epic Rover. It provides users enterprise-grade, barcode scanning strength – using only the camera on an iOS device. CortexDecoder can scan over 40 different barcode symbologies, allowing healthcare workers to seamlessly move from one workflow to another.

This new enterprise barcode scanning feature is a long-awaited workflow solution and Rush is excited to leverage this new technology.  Software-enabled barcode scanning of patient wristbands to access medical records coupled with the ability to scan and verify medications helps to eliminate errors and improve patient safety – making soft-scanning a huge win for both the medical staff and their patients.

“CortexDecoder for Epic Rover enables Rush to use the five rights of medication administration: right patient, right medication, right dose, and right route at the right time.  This technology will help to reduce the chance of medication harm and decrease the cost of care – which are pillars in achieving the Quadruple Aim”, says Dr. Shafiq Rab, Chief Information Officer of Rush.

The regional-focused Quadruple Aim initiative is based on a core belief that solutions to national problems, like healthcare, can be found and designed at local levels. For the individual healthcare consumer, this translates to outcomes of better culture, better care, better health, and lower costs.

“CortexDecoder reduces the need for cumbersome handheld devices carried by nurses, helping us achieve another pillar of the Quadruple Aim: improving the work life of healthcare providers, clinicians and staff, known as <a href="https://www.mihia.org/index.php/provider-well-being">Provider Well-Being</a>”, says Lisa Swiontek, Associate Vice President, Clinical Information Systems at Rush.

“We are excited to be working with Rush on this first adoption and rollout of soft-scanning,” said Garrett Russell, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Code. “The healthcare industry has been waiting for the next ‘big thing’ and combining CortexDecoder with Epic Rover is it. This is a huge step for the industry, and Rush is at the forefront of this mobility revolution.”
